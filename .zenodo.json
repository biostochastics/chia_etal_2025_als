  "description": "Comprehensive reanalysis demonstrating severe confounding between plasma collection tube type, geographic origin, and diagnosis in an ALS biomarker study published in Nature Medicine. This repository includes: (1) leave-country-out cross-validation showing 18.2% performance drop, (2) stratified differential analysis revealing only 26.9% protein replication across cohorts, (3) identification of 22 tube-robust biomarker candidates, and (4) complete reproducible pipeline.",
